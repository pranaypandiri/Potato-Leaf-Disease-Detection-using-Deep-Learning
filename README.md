# Potato-Leaf-Disease-Detection-using-Deep-Learning

This project explores the automated classification of potato diseases using deep learning and convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The study employs a diverse dataset comprising images of healthy potatoes and those afflicted with common diseases such as late blight and early blight. Through meticulous preprocessing and fine-tuning of pre- trained CNN models, including Inception V3, ResNet-50, VGG-19, and MobileNet, the research aims to discern the most effective model for accurate disease classification. Remarkably, after extensive evaluation, ResNet-50 emerges as the top performer, achieving an outstanding accuracy rate of 99.71%. This exceptional accuracy underscores ResNet-50's ability to distinguish subtle differences between healthy and diseased potato plants, highlighting its potential for precise disease diagnosis in agriculture. The findings hold promise for revolutionizing disease management practices, offering farmers efficient tools to mitigate yield losses and ensure food security. By leveraging deep learning techniques, this research contributes to the development of real-time systems for on-field disease detection, enabling timely interventions and targeted agricultural practices. Moreover, the study sets a precedent for employing advanced technology in agricultural sectors, emphasizing the importance of machine learning in addressing pressing challenges faced by farmers worldwide. Ultimately, the successful implementation of deep learning models in potato disease classification signifies a significant step forward in enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability, paving the way for a more resilient and efficient food production system in the face of evolving environmental and economic pressures.
